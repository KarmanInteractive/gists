# Public gists
Since GitHub doesn't allow organisations to host gists the way a user can we've created this repository.

This repository is a collection of one off scripts that we've shared publically through blog posts, presentations, or some other medium.

To track where these scripts are referenced make sure to list any references you've made to these scripts below.
